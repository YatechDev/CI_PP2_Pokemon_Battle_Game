My second portfolio project for Code Institute where I study for a diploma - LVL 5 in Full Stack Software Development.

The aim of this project is to demonstrate skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and only these languages were used in the
development. No frameworks or other languages have been used apart from the parts used to Code Institute Template.

The website is responsive to lower screen resolutions, tablets and mobile phones.
It is also compatible with all popular web browsers.

The website is divided into subpages, but all of them are consistent, simple and pleasant to navigate.
It contains easy & fun to view elements and all the necessary information, such as the game rules & author details.

## Design
![Game Design](docs/design/design_home.png)

The design of the game is intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing to our target audience. I wanted the game
interface to be user-friendly, with clear instructions and simple navigation, so that players can quickly understand the
rules and start playing without any confusion. The game is designed to be responsive and optimized for different
devices, such as computers, tablets, and mobile phones, ensuring accessibility for all players.

To create a nostalgic and familiar experience for Pokémon fans, we incorporated elements of the franchise, such as
colors, characters, and logos, into the visual design. I also added different levels of difficulty, which are
represented through unique character designs and backgrounds, providing players with a sense of difficulty and
accomplishment.

I wanted the game to be visually engaging and fast-paced to keep players interested and entertained throughout the
gameplay experience. I am not a designer but still I worked hard to create a fun and enjoyable experience for players,
while also remaining true to our project goals and target audience. Overall, the design of our game is tailored to 
provide a satisfying and immersive gaming experience for players of all ages and skill levels.
